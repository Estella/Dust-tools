A set of tools for exploring network filtering which require the pcap module
Currently the pcap module only works on Linux

# Replay #

The Replay tool requires a recorded conversation in the form of a Packetstream file.
Packetstream files are a cross-platform format which you can get by converting .pcap files.
The .pcap files are direct recordings of traffic. You must supply your own .pcap files. You can record them using Wireshark.
Converting .pcap fils to the Packetstream format requires the Dust-tools-pcap package, which only works on Linux.

To record traffic to a .pcap file (requires Dust-tools-pcap):

replay-convert [pcap-file] [tcp|udp] [port] [packetstream-file]

Example:

replay-convert http.pcap tcp 80 http.packets

# Shaper #

The Shaper tool requires a protocol model in the form of an Observation file.
Observation files are a cross-platform format which you can get by converting .pcap files or using live traffic capture.
The .pcap files are direct recordings of traffic. You can supply your own .pcap files. You can record them using Wireshark.
You can also skip .pcap files entirely and just capture live traffic directly to Observation files.
Both converting .pcap files and recording live traffic require the Dust-tools-pcap package, which only works on Linux.

To record live traffic to an Observation file or convert a .pcap file (requires Dust-tools-pcap):

shaper-update [pcap-file | --live device count] [port] [observation-file]

Example:

shaper=update http.pcap 80 http.obs

or

shaper-update --live eth0 1024 http.obs

You can run shaper-update multiple times on the same Observation file and it will aggregate observed traffic.
